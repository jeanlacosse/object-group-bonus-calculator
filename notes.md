Find my own way to make the assignment easier for myself.
Don't write in long-form paragraphs, do a pre-prep by writing it out better or drawing it or somethign more organized that can be done one at a time.
Set of checkboxes of each thing I need to do is best. Can check off as I go, perfect for my thinking style.

Good to have an else statement in my conditionals that ccan log something in case there was information the system doesn't recognize
my git commits should represent what I have finished in my new checkboxes in the todo

can run many if condisiontals in the same function. Better to do as much in one function as possible as I often need newly found varialbes to be called and it doesn't always make sense to run those variables into another function, can be confusing to do.

ie: list
THE FUNCTION --- name the goal something
 [ ] first thing I need to do
 [ ] second thing to do
    [ ] something within the second thing
